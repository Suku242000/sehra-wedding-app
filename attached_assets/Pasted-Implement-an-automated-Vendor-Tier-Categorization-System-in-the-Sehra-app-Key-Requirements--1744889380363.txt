Implement an automated Vendor Tier Categorization System in the Sehra app.

‚ú® Key Requirements:

1. **Vendor Quality Score (SQS) Engine**:
   - Each vendor should be evaluated with a score out of 100.
   - Scoring criteria (with weights):
     - Client Ratings (out of 30%)
     - Booking Completion Rate (20%)
     - Response Time (10%)
     - Years of Experience (10%)
     - Portfolio Quality (10%)
     - Region Flexibility (10%)
     - Verified Business Documents (10%)

2. **Tier Assignment Logic**:
   - Platinum: 86 ‚Äì 100
   - Gold: 61 ‚Äì 85
   - Silver: 0 ‚Äì 60
   - Automatically categorize vendors based on SQS.

3. **Database Fields**:
   - Add `sqsScore` and `category` to each vendor schema (e.g., `vendor.sqsScore = 92`, `vendor.category = "Platinum"`).
   - On vendor profile update or new registration, re-evaluate and assign.

4. **Real-Time Display**:
   - On the Vendor Dashboard, show their tier badge (Gold/Platinum/Silver) with score and review summary.
   - On the Client and Supervisor dashboards, allow filtering vendors by tier.
   - Add visual tier indicators like icons or color ribbons.

5. **Admin Panel**:
   - Show vendor evaluation metrics.
   - Allow admin to override vendor tier manually (with a reason).
   - Option to schedule automatic re-evaluations (e.g., monthly or after each booking).

6. **Reactivity & Sync**:
   - After vendor updates or customer reviews, automatically recalculate the SQS and refresh category in real-time (without manual reload).

7. **Optional Enhancements**:
   - Add badges (Gold Certified / Platinum Elite) on vendor cards.
   - Show average rating, recent review, and performance summary in the vendor tile.
   - Trigger badge unlock celebration animation when vendors level up.

üîÅ Integration:
- Fully integrate this tier system with:
  - Supervisor view (to suggest high-tier vendors)
  - Client dashboard (to highlight premium vendor options)
  - Admin dashboard analytics

üß™ Testing:
- Test with vendors of varying quality to ensure categories are correctly assigned.
- Confirm real-time update propagation across all dashboards.
- Simulate vendor rating, document upload, and booking completion to validate score updates.

üéØ Goal:
Deliver a smart, scalable, and interactive vendor trust system that builds confidence for customers while rewarding high-performing vendors.
