Seamless Supervisor Allocation + Auto-Sync Customer Details to Supervisor
Implement a real-time customer-supervisor connection system in the Sehra App (React.js + Tailwind + Node.js + MongoDB Atlas). When a supervisor is assigned to a customer, the connection should be instant and seamless — with mandatory customer contact update and auto-push of details to supervisor dashboard.

✅ Functional Requirements
👥 Supervisor Allocation Logic
On the backend (Node.js + MongoDB Atlas), when a supervisor is assigned to a customer:

Update customer document with supervisorId

Update supervisor’s assignedClients[] array with that customer’s _id

📇 Mandatory Customer Contact Form
On first login or entry to /dashboard/client, check if phoneNumber, address, or location fields are empty.

If any are missing:

Redirect to /dashboard/client/contact-setup

Display form: Name, Phone Number, City, Pincode, State

Form cannot be skipped.

On successful submit:

Update customer record in MongoDB

Trigger real-time push to assigned supervisor (see below)

🔄 Real-time Sync to Supervisor
Use Socket.IO or direct API call to:

Send updated customer details (name, contact, location, wedding date, budget plan) to the assigned supervisor’s dashboard

Supervisor dashboard (/dashboard/supervisor) will show:

🔔 "New Client Assigned" toast alert

Click to view client profile with all updated details

"Mark as Contacted" button (updates a field in customer.supervisorStatus = 'contacted')

💬 Quick Supervisor ↔ Customer Communication
Enable a Chat Now button after supervisor assignment.

Use Socket.IO for real-time messaging

Store chat history under messages collection: {from, to, message, timestamp}

🛡️ Security & UX Notes
Supervisor login is restricted to /auth/supervisor only (as already set)

Clients cannot access supervisor dashboard, and vice versa

Admin can override and reassign supervisors from /dashboard/admin/users

🔧 Backend Flow
POST /api/assign-supervisor

Body: { customerId, supervisorId }

Actions:

Add supervisorId to customer

Add customerId to supervisor.assignedClients[]

Emit supervisorAssigned socket event if supervisor is online

PATCH /api/customer/:id/contact

Body: { phoneNumber, address, city, pincode, state }

Update user data

If supervisorId exists, auto-push to supervisor dashboard

GET /api/supervisor/:id/clients

Fetch all assigned clients with full info for supervisor

🧪 Testing Flow
 Log in as customer → redirected to contact info form if empty

 Fill contact info → customer dashboard unlocks

 Backend assigns supervisor (via Admin or auto-match)

 Supervisor gets real-time alert + full client info instantly

 Chat button appears for both client and supervisor
