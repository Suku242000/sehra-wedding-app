Create a fully functional **Admin User Management Panel** for the Sehra wedding platform using React, Tailwind CSS, and Axios for API integration.

Admin Dashboard > User Management Module Requirements:

1. Overview Panel:
   - Table listing all users (Supervisors and other admin users)
   - Columns: ID, Name, Email, Role, Status, Assigned Clients, Created Date, Actions

2. Create New User (especially Supervisor):
   - Form with fields: Full Name, Email, Role (dropdown: Supervisor/Admin), Password (auto-generate or manual)
   - Once a Supervisor is created, assign a **unique ID** (format: `S#0001`, incrementing per user)
   - New account credentials should be auto-sent to the supervisor (simulate SendGrid for now)
   - Add Location-based assignment (dropdown: Mumbai, Delhi, etc.)

3. Edit User:
   - Update name, email, location, role (except ID)
   - Toggle Active/Inactive status

4. Delete User:
   - Confirm modal before deletion
   - Remove association with assigned clients/vendors if Supervisor is deleted

5. Change Password:
   - Secure password reset form
   - Optional toggle: “Send password reset link” or manual override

6. Filters and Search:
   - Filter users by role (Supervisor/Admin), location, or status
   - Search by name or email

7. Admin-only Action Logs (optional):
   - View all changes made by any admin (audit trail)
   - Timestamped logs of user creations/edits/deletes

8. API Endpoints:
   - GET /admin/users
   - POST /admin/users/create
   - PUT /admin/users/:id/edit
   - DELETE /admin/users/:id/delete
   - PATCH /admin/users/:id/password

9. UI/UX Enhancements:
   - Smooth animations for modals/forms (Framer Motion)
   - Toasts for success/error messages
   - Responsive design for mobile/tablet use
   - Use Sehra brand palette: Royal Maroon, Classic Gold, etc.

10. File path:
   - Create under: `/sehra-internal/src/pages/admin/UserManagement.jsx`

Note:
- All operations must be protected by Admin role auth middleware.
- Supervisor accounts should not be manually editable by anyone else.
