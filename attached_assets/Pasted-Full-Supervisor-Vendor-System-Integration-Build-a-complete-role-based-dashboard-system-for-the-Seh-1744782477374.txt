Full Supervisor + Vendor System Integration
Build a complete role-based dashboard system for the Sehra wedding planning app using React.js, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, deployed on Replit.

Core Roles:

Customer (Bride/Groom)

Vendor (Photographer, Hotel, etc.)

Supervisor (Internal Staff Only)

Admin (Superuser)

🔐 Authentication & Routing:
Use JWT for secure role-based login.

Setup 4 login pages: /login-customer, /login-vendor, /login-supervisor, /admin.

Protect dashboards with role-based middleware in Express.

Separate React Routes for each role, based on login token.

📋 Unique ID Generation:
On registration:

Customer gets ID starting from S#0001, then S#0002, auto-incremented.

Vendor gets ID starting from SV#0001, SV#0002, auto-incremented.

Supervisor gets ID from admin only, starting from SP#0001.

Use a MongoDB model like Counter to track and auto-increment unique IDs.

🧑‍💼 Supervisor Functionality:
Admin can create supervisor accounts via /admin/supervisors/create.

Supervisors get login info auto-sent (no public signup).

Supervisor dashboard:

See Assigned Customers and Vendors

Edit/Delete Customer/Vendor Profiles

Connect Vendor with Customers (match services)

Mark themselves available/unavailable

View unassigned Vendors and assist them in profile setup

View and track assigned tasks

🧑‍🍳 Vendor Dashboard:
After login, vendors see:

Vendor categories (dynamic dropdown on register):

🎨 Frontend:

Role-based sidebars (Customer, Vendor, Supervisor, Admin)

Navbar shows name, role, and logout

Use icons for clarity (Heroicons or Lucide)

Responsive design with clean color palette:

Royal Maroon #800000, Classic Gold #FFD700, Ivory, Soft Pink, Rich Gray

🧪 Testing:
✅ Test registration for Customer/Vendor assigns correct Unique ID

✅ Supervisor can login from separate page and see only Supervisor Dashboard

✅ Admin can create Supervisor, which gets unique SP# ID

✅ Vendors can login, manage profile, and see wedding bookings

✅ Supervisors can edit customer/vendor profiles

✅ Prevent unauthorized access across dashboards

✅ Ensure each role routes to proper landing page after login

✅ Token expires and forces re-login securely
