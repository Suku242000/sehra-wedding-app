Build a production-ready Home Page (public landing page) for the Sehra wedding planning app using React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations. This should be separate from the user dashboard and accessible at the root / route. Use beautiful design, animations, and Indian wedding-themed imagery to give a premium feel.

Hero section with Sehra logo, tagline: “Your Wedding, Our Responsibility”, CTA buttons: “Get Started” → redirects to Login/Signup.

Add animations on scroll and transitions between sections.

✨ Enhancements:

Framer Motion entrance animation for each section

Navbar with “Home | Packages | Testimonials | Contact | Login”

Button hover and entrance effects

Lazy load any images to improve performance

🔁 Routing:
